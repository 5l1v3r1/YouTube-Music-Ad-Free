# Google Music (YouTube Music Ad-Free) 

Simple, easy and without any bullshit. 

### Is ad-blocking illegal or against Tos?

[Ad-blocking is legal](https://www.zdnet.com/article/adblock-plus-scores-big-legal-win-it-doesnt-break-antitrust-law-court-rules/) and everyone has the right to ad-block the website/service.


### Does it violates Google own ToS?

No, because the APK as well as the modded Desktop client do not manipulate the offered services nor uses shady tricks or fake accounts to archive the goal (_blocking ads_).


### Bypassing Premium features sounds against ToS!

No it's not, I use loopholes in order to archive it. I can't go into specific details (_because Google would close the hole_) but the decoding process is considerable not a hack to obtain high quality music. It' abuses a weakness in the encryption layer.
